/**
 * Created by dianafisher on 11/21/17.
 *
 * The brute-force method, and simplest, is to compute and store all possible string permutations
 * in an array, and iterate through, checking. However, as discussed above, this results in an
 * terrific O(n!) time â€“ unacceptable.
 *
 * Instead, we can solve this problem by counting characters.
 *
 * Another acceptable approach is to sort both strings, comparing each entry of the sorted strings.
 * Since all permutations have the same number of characters, the sorted strings must be identical.
 * Sorting, however, is dependent on input sequence, and adds another layer of complexity to the code.
 * Counting characters is simple and direct.
